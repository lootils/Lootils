## What's In The Library
This library is a work in progress. More stuff is coming soon.

### UUID
This class handles UUID v3, v4, and v5. Read the [documentation](https://github.com/mattfarina/Lootils-UUID) for all the gory details.

## License
Lootils is released under a MIT like license.

## What's In A Name?
[Loo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loo_(wind)) is the name of a strong, hot, and dry summer afternoon wind in the spring in India.

Or... it could be [loo](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loo#Etymology_1) as in the British slang. 

Think of this like choosing between which license you want to use on a dual licensed library. Except this library only has one license and you're choosing the meaning behind the name. Choose the name your project lead (or other biz decision maker) will like the best.
